        <h2 class="section-heading">What we offer</h2>

            <p>Want to lose weight? Cardiovascular exercise burns calories and improves overall health. It can reduce belly fat, promote brain growth, prevent stress,
                and help you focus.
            </p>
            <li><a href="stress.html">Relax</a></li>
            <p>Stressed out? Stress can weaken the immune system and cause high blood pressure, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and even heart disease. Learn ways to manage and 
                reduce stress.

            <li><a href="diet.html">Eat what's right</a></li>

        <h1 class="section-heading">How to prepare to Shape Up!</h1>
        <h2 class= "section-heading"> Get a check up</h2>
        <p>If you have any health issues or take any medication, be sure to consult with your healthcare provider before beginning a new exercise or diet program.</p>
        <h2 class= "section-heading"> Dress for Success</h2>
        <p>Workout clothes should be comfy. While exercising, you should be thinking about what you're doing, not what you're wearing.
            That includes good shoes, which are essential for running, jogging, or walking, and socks that absorb shock and sweat.
        </p>
        <h2 class= "section-heading"> Equipment?</h2>
        <p>You don't need to buy a lot of fancy equipment to get in shape. But you might want to invest in a yoga mat, a large exercise ball, or some weights depending on your Shape Up! plan.</p>
        <p>How many times have you started a new workout routine or diet? And how many times has it failed to give you the results you want?

        <h2 class= "section-heading"> Resist Temptation</h2>
        <p>It's hard to eat right when everyone else is buying lunch in a fast food restaurant. Invest in some good food containers and 
            bring your healthy lunch and snacks. Your body and your waiter will thank you.
